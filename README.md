# NewScraper
Scrape news articles for personal perusal.

 * Headline - the title of the article

 * Summary - a short summary of the article

 * URL - the url to the original article

 * Feel free to add more content to your database (photos, bylines, and so on).

Users should also be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments should be saved to the database as well and associated with their articles. Users should also be able to delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.



Beyond these requirements, be creative and have fun with this!
